  abstract     = {Composite endpoints are frequently used in clinical trials, but simple approaches, such as the time to first event, do not reflect any ordering among the endpoints. However, some endpoints, such as mortality, are worse than others. A variety of procedures have been proposed to reflect the severity of the individual endpoints such as pairwise ranking approaches, the win ratio, and the desirability of outcome ranking. When patients have different lengths of follow-up, however, ranking can be difficult and proposed methods do not naturally lead to regression approaches and require specialized software. This paper defines an ordering score O to operationalize the patient ranking implied by hierarchical endpoints. We show how differential right censoring of follow-up corresponds to multiple interval censoring of the ordering score allowing standard software for survival models to be used to calculate the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators (NPMLEs) of different measures. Additionally, if one assumes that the ordering score is transformable to an exponential random variable, a semiparametric regression is obtained, which is equivalent to the proportional hazards model subject to multiple interval censoring. Standard software can be used for estimation. We show that the NPMLE can be poorly behaved compared to the simple estimators in staggered entry trials. We also show that the semiparametric estimator can be more efficient than simple estimators and explore how standard Cox regression maneuvers can be used to assess model fit, allow for flexible generalizations, and assess interactions of covariates with treatment. We analyze a trial of short versus long-term antiplatelet therapy using our methods.},

  abstract     = {Background and Purpose—Although the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used primary end point in acute stroke trials, its power is limited when analyzed in dichotomized fashion and its indication of effect size challenging to interpret when analyzed ordinally. Weighting the 7 Rankin levels by utilities may improve scale interpretability while preserving statistical power.Methods—A utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) was derived by averaging values from time-tradeoff (patient centered) and person-tradeoff (clinician centered) studies. The UW-mRS, standard ordinal mRS, and dichotomized mRS were applied to 11 trials or meta-analyses of acute stroke treatments, including lytic, endovascular reperfusion, blood pressure moderation, and hemicraniectomy interventions.Results—Utility values were 1.0 for mRS level 0; 0.91 for mRS level 1; 0.76 for mRS level 2; 0.65 for mRS level 3; 0.33 for mRS level 4; 0 for mRS level 5; and 0 for mRS level 6. For trials with unidirectional treatment effects, the UW-mRS paralleled the ordinal mRS and outperformed dichotomous mRS analyses. Both the UW-mRS and the ordinal mRS were statistically significant in 6 of 8 unidirectional effect trials, whereas dichotomous analyses were statistically significant in 2 to 4 of 8. In bidirectional effect trials, both the UW-mRS and ordinal tests captured the divergent treatment effects by showing neutral results, whereas some dichotomized analyses showed positive results. Mean utility differences in trials with statistically significant positive results ranged from 0.026 to 0.249.Conclusions—A UW-mRS performs similar to the standard ordinal mRS in detecting treatment effects in actual stroke trials and ensures the quantitative outcome is a valid reflection of patient-centered benefits.}

Since biological systems tend to be neither linear, nor hierarchical in nature, the assumptions of traditional multivariate statistical methods based on the linear model can often not be justi ed on theoretical grounds. Establishing concept validity through empirical validation is not only problematic, but also time consuming. This paper proposes the use of u-statistics for scoring multivariate ordinal data and a family of simple nonparametric tests for analysis. The scoring method is demonstrated to be applicable to scoring clinical response pro les in the treatment of psoriasis and then to identifying genomic pathways that best correlate with these pro les.

  abstract     = {Background and Purpose—The utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (UW-mRS) has been proposed as a new patient-centered primary outcome in stroke trials. We aimed to describe utility weights for the mRS health states and to evaluate the statistical efficiency of the UW-mRS to detect treatment effects in stroke intervention trials.Methods—We used data of the 500 patients enrolled in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). Utility values were elicited from the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire assessed at 90 days after inclusion, simultaneously with the mRS. Utility weights were determined by averaging the utilities of all patients within each mRS category. We performed simulations to evaluate statistical efficiency. The simulated treatment effect was an odds ratio of 1.65 in favor of the treatment arm, similar for all mRS cutoffs. This treatment effect was analyzed using 3 approaches: linear regression with the UW-mRS as outcome, binary logistic regression with a dichotomized mRS (0–1/2–6, 0–2/3–6, and 0–4/5–6), and proportional odds logistic regression with the ordinal mRS. The statistical power of the 3 approaches was expressed as the proportion of 10\,000 simulations that resulted in a statistically significant treatment effect (P≤0.05).Results—The mean utility values (SD) for mRS categories 0 to 6 were: 0.95 (0.08), 0.93 (0.13), 0.83 (0.21), 0.62 (0.27), 0.42 (0.28), 0.11 (0.28), and 0 (0), respectively, but varied substantially between individual patients within each category. The UW-mRS approach was more efficient than the dichotomous approach (power 85\% versus 71\%) but less efficient than the ordinal approach (power 85\% versus 87\%).Conclusions—The UW-mRS as primary outcome does not capture individual variation in utility values and may reduce the statistical power of a randomized trial.}

  abstract     = {Effect sizes (ES) tell the magnitude of the difference between treatments and, ideally, should tell clinicians how likely their patients will benefit from the treatment. Currently used ES are expressed in statistical rather than in clinically useful terms and may not give clinicians the appropriate information. We restrict our discussion to studies with two groups: one with n patients receiving a new treatment and the other with m patients receiving the usual or no treatment. The standardized mean difference (e.g. Cohen's d) is a well-known index for continuous outcomes. There is some intuitive value to d, but measuring improvement in standard deviations (SD) is a statistical concept that may not help a clinician. How much improvement is a half SD? A more intuitive and simple-to-calculate ES is the probability that the response of a patient given the new treatment (X) is better than the one for a randomly chosen patient given the old or no treatment (Y) (i.e. P(X {$>$} Y), larger values meaning better outcomes). This probability has an immediate identity with the area under the curve (AUC) measure in procedures for receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve comparing responses to two treatments. It also can be easily calculated from the Mann–Whitney U, Wilcoxon, or Kendall τ statistics. We describe the characteristics of an ideal ES. We propose P(X {$>$} Y) as an alternative index, summarize its correspondence with well-known non-parametric statistics, compare it to the standardized mean difference index, and illustrate with clinical data.

For the more general latent variable model for ordinal responses that corresponds to a linear model with other possible error distributions and corresponding link functions for cumulative multinomial probabilities, the ordinal superiority measure equals with the log–log link and equals approximately with the logit link, where is the group effect. Another ordinal superiority measure generalizes the difference of proportions from binary to ordinal responses. We also present related measures directly for ordinal models for the observed response that need not assume corresponding latent response models. We present confidence intervals for the measures and illustrate with an example.},

Generalized pairwise comparisons can include an arbitrary number of (possibly prioritized) outcomes and thresholds of clinical relevance. They extend standard nonparametric tests and lead to a general measure of the difference between the groups, the “Net Benefit,” which is the probability that a patient randomly selected from the treatment group has a better outcome than a patient randomly selected from the control group, minus the probability of the opposite situation. One flexible approach to the analysis is to prioritize the outcomes from the most important to the least important. The order of priorities can be patient-dependent, and as such this approach paves the way to personalized medicine.},

  abstract  = {Wassily Hoeffding was born on June 12, 1914 in Mustamaki, Finland, near St. Petersburg (now Leningrad), USSR. His parents were of Danish origin; his father was an economist and his mother had studied medicine. Although at that time, Finland was a part of the Russian Empire, the Bolshevik movement was quite intense and consolidated under the Lenin dictatorship in the Civil War of 1918-20. The Hoeffding family left Russia for Denmark in 1920, and four years later, they moved on to Berlin. In 1933, Wassily finished high school and went on to college to study economics. However, a year later, he gave up economics and entered Berlin University to study mathematics. He earned a Ph.D. degree from Berlin University in 1940 with a dissertation in correlation theory, which dealt with some properties of bivariate distributions that are invariant under arbitrary monotone transformations of the margins. In this context, he studied some (mostly, descriptive) aspects of rank correlations, and a few years later, while investigating the sampling aspects of such measures, he formulated in a remarkably general and highly original form the general distribution theory of symmetric, unbiased estimators (which he termed U-statistics). This is depicted in this outstanding article (under commentary). During World War II, Wassily worked in Berlin partly as an editorial assistant and partly as a research assistant in actuarial science. In September 1946, he was able to immigrate to the United States, and there he started attending lectures at Columbia University in New York. In 1947, he was invited by Harold Hotelling to join the newly established department of Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Since then Wassily had been in Chapel Hill with occasional visits to other campuses (Columbia University and Cornell University in New York, the Steklov Institute in Leningrad, USSR, and the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta, among others). In 1979, he retired from active service. He died on February 28, 1991 at Chapel Hill.},

  abstract     = {Mann–Whitney-type causal effects are generally applicable to outcome variables with a natural ordering, have been recommended for clinical trials because of their clinical relevance and interpretability and are particularly useful in analysing an ordinal composite outcome that combines an original primary outcome with death and possibly treatment discontinuation. In this article, we consider robust and efficient estimation of such causal effects in observational studies and clinical trials. For observational studies, we propose and compare several estimators: regression estimators based on an outcome regression (OR) model or a generalised probabilistic index (GPI) model, an inverse probability weighted estimator based on a propensity score model and two doubly robust (DR), locally efficient estimators. One of the DR estimators involves a propensity score model and an OR model, is consistent and asymptotically normal under the union of the two models and attains the semiparametric information bound when both models are correct. The other DR estimator has the same properties with the OR model replaced by a GPI model. For clinical trials, we extend an existing augmented estimator based on a GPI model and propose a new one based on an OR model. The methods are evaluated and compared in simulation experiments and applied to a clinical trial in cardiology and an observational study in obstetrics.}

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to create a functional status outcome measure for large outcome studies that is well defined, quantitative, rapid, reliable, minimally dependent on subjective assessments, and applicable to hospitalized pediatric patients across a wide range of ages and inpatient environments. METHODS: Functional Status Scale (FSS) domains of functioning included mental status, sensory functioning, communication, motor functioning, feeding, and respiratory status, categorized from normal (score 1) to very severe dysfunction (score 5). The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System II (ABAS II) established construct validity and calibration within domains. Seven institutions provided PICU patients within 24 hours before or after PICU discharge, high-risk nonPICU patients within 24 hours after admission, and technology-dependent children. Primary care nurses completed the ABAS II. Statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 836 children, with a mean FSS score of 10.3 (SD: 4.4), were studied. Eighteen percent had the minimal possible FSS score of 6, 44\% had FSS scores of 10, 14\% had FSS scores of 15, and 6\% had FSS scores of 20. Each FSS domain was associated with mean ABAS II scores (P .0001). Cells in each domain were collapsed and reweighted, which improved correlations with ABAS II scores (P .001 for improvements). Discrimination was very good for moderate and severe dysfunction (ABAS II categories) and improved with FSS weighting. Intraclass correlations of original and weighted total FSS scores were 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The FSS met our objectives and is well suited for large outcome studies.

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term ({$>$} 6 mo) functional status of PICU patients with significant new functional morbidities at hospital discharge. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort followed-up using structured chart reviews of electronic health records. SETTING: Electronic health records of former PICU patients at seven sites. PATIENTS: Randomly selected patients from the Trichotomous Outcome Prediction in Critical Care study discharged from the hospital with new functional status morbidity who had sufficient electronic health record data to determine functional status. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Long-term functional status was measured with the Functional Status Scale and categorized by comparison to hospital discharge Functional Status Scale. Improvement or new morbidity was based on a change in Functional Status Scale of greater than or equal to 2 in a single domain. Overall, 56\% (n = 71) improved, 15\% (n = 19) did not change, 9\% (n = 11) developed a new morbidity, and 21\% (n = 26) died. The shortest median follow-up time from PICU discharge was 1.4 years for those who died and the longest was 4.0 years for those improved. Functional status at baseline (pre-acute illness) was different among the outcome groups with those that improved having the highest frequency of baseline normal status or only mild dysfunction. Of the longterm survivors with improvement, 82\% (n = 58) improved to normal status or mild dysfunction, 11\% (n = 8) improved to moderate dysfunction, and 7\% (n = 5) improved to severe dysfunction. Trauma patients improved and cancer patients died more frequently than other diagnoses. The long-term outcome groups were not associated with hospital discharge functional status. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of PICU survivors discharged with significant new functional morbidity with follow-up after 6 or more months improved, many to normal status or only mild dysfunction, while 29\% died or developed new morbidity. Of the long-term survivors, 70\% had significant improvement after a median follow-up time of 4.0 years.},

When several outcomes are considered, they must be prioritized. We show that generalized pairwise comparisons extend well-known non-parametric tests, and illustrate their interest using data from two randomized clinical trials. We also show that they lead to a general measure of the difference between the groups called the ‘proportion in favor of treatment’, denoted Δ, which is related to traditional measures of treatment effect for a single variable.

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE To delineate test characteristics of the pSOFA score for predicting in-hospital mortality among (1) all patients and (2) patients with suspected infection treated in pediatric EDs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study took place from January 1, 2012, to January 31, 2020 in 9 US children’s hospitals included in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry. The data was analyzed from February 1, 2020, to April 18, 2022. All ED visits for patients younger than 18 years were included. EXPOSURES ED pSOFA score was assigned by summing maximum pSOFA organ dysfunction components during ED stay (each 0-4 points). In the subset with suspected infection, visit meeting criteria for sepsis (suspected infection with a pSOFA score of 2 or more) and septic shock (suspected infection with vasoactive infusion and serum lactate level {$>$}18.0 mg/dL) were identified. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Test characteristics of pSOFA scores of 2 or more during the ED stay for hospital mortality. RESULTS A total of 3 999 528 (female, 47.3\%) ED visits were included. pSOFA scores ranged from 0 to 16, with 126 250 visits (3.2\%) having a pSOFA score of 2 or more. pSOFA scores of 2 or more had sensitivity of 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.62-0.67) and specificity of 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.97-0.97), with negative predictive value of 1.0 (95\% CI, 1.00-1.00) in predicting hospital mortality. Of 642 868 patients with suspected infection (16.1\%), 42 992 (6.7\%) met criteria for sepsis, and 374 (0.1\%) met criteria for septic shock. Hospital mortality rates for suspected infection (599 502), sepsis (42 992), and septic shock (374) were 0.0\%, 0.9\%, and 8.0\%, respectively. The pSOFA score had similar discrimination for hospital mortality in all ED visits (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.82) and the subset with suspected infection (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large, multicenter study of pediatric ED visits, a pSOFA score of 2 or more was uncommon and associated with increased hospital mortality yet had poor sensitivity as a screening tool for hospital mortality. Conversely, children with a pSOFA score of 2 or less were at very low risk of death, with high specificity and negative predictive value. Among patients with suspected infection, patients with pSOFA-defined septic shock demonstrated the highest mortality.},

Specific and harmonized guidance as to what outcome-specific information should be reported in publications of clinical trials is needed to reduce deficient reporting practices that obscure issues with outcome selection, assessment, and analysis.To develop harmonized, evidence- and consensus-based standards for reporting outcomes in clinical trial reports through integration with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement.Using the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) methodological framework, the CONSORT-Outcomes 2022 extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement was developed by (1) generation and evaluation of candidate outcome reporting items via consultation with experts and a scoping review of existing guidance for reporting trial outcomes (published within the 10 years prior to March 19, 2018) identified through expert solicitation, electronic database searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Methodology Register, gray literature searches, and reference list searches; (2) a 3-round international Delphi voting process (November 2018-February 2019) completed by 124 panelists from 22 countries to rate and identify additional items; and (3) an in-person consensus meeting (April 9-10, 2019) attended by 25 panelists to identify essential items for the reporting of outcomes in clinical trial reports.The scoping review and consultation with experts identified 128 recommendations relevant to reporting outcomes in trial reports, the majority (83\%) of which were not included in the CONSORT 2010 statement. All recommendations were consolidated into 64 items for Delphi voting; after the Delphi survey process, 30 items met criteria for further evaluation at the consensus meeting and possible inclusion in the CONSORT-Outcomes 2022 extension. The discussions during and after the consensus meeting yielded 17 items that elaborate on the CONSORT 2010 statement checklist items and are related to completely defining and justifying the trial outcomes, including how and when they were assessed (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 6a), defining and justifying the target difference between treatment groups during sample size calculations (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 7a), describing the statistical methods used to compare groups for the primary and secondary outcomes (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 12a), and describing the prespecified analyses and any outcome analyses not prespecified (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 18).This CONSORT-Outcomes 2022 extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement provides 17 outcome-specific items that should be addressed in all published clinical trial reports and may help increase trial utility, replicability, and transparency and may minimize the risk of selective nonreporting of trial results.}

  abstract     = {Background and Purpose—Although the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used primary end point in acute stroke trials, its power is limited when analyzed in dichotomized fashion and its indication of effect size challenging to interpret when analyzed ordinally. Weighting the 7 Rankin levels by utilities may improve scale interpretability while preserving statistical power.Methods—A utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) was derived by averaging values from time-tradeoff (patient centered) and person-tradeoff (clinician centered) studies. The UW-mRS, standard ordinal mRS, and dichotomized mRS were applied to 11 trials or meta-analyses of acute stroke treatments, including lytic, endovascular reperfusion, blood pressure moderation, and hemicraniectomy interventions.Results—Utility values were 1.0 for mRS level 0; 0.91 for mRS level 1; 0.76 for mRS level 2; 0.65 for mRS level 3; 0.33 for mRS level 4; 0 for mRS level 5; and 0 for mRS level 6. For trials with unidirectional treatment effects, the UW-mRS paralleled the ordinal mRS and outperformed dichotomous mRS analyses. Both the UW-mRS and the ordinal mRS were statistically significant in 6 of 8 unidirectional effect trials, whereas dichotomous analyses were statistically significant in 2 to 4 of 8. In bidirectional effect trials, both the UW-mRS and ordinal tests captured the divergent treatment effects by showing neutral results, whereas some dichotomized analyses showed positive results. Mean utility differences in trials with statistically significant positive results ranged from 0.026 to 0.249.Conclusions—A UW-mRS performs similar to the standard ordinal mRS in detecting treatment effects in actual stroke trials and ensures the quantitative outcome is a valid reflection of patient-centered benefits.}

  abstract     = {Background and Purpose—The utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (UW-mRS) has been proposed as a new patient-centered primary outcome in stroke trials. We aimed to describe utility weights for the mRS health states and to evaluate the statistical efficiency of the UW-mRS to detect treatment effects in stroke intervention trials.Methods—We used data of the 500 patients enrolled in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). Utility values were elicited from the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire assessed at 90 days after inclusion, simultaneously with the mRS. Utility weights were determined by averaging the utilities of all patients within each mRS category. We performed simulations to evaluate statistical efficiency. The simulated treatment effect was an odds ratio of 1.65 in favor of the treatment arm, similar for all mRS cutoffs. This treatment effect was analyzed using 3 approaches: linear regression with the UW-mRS as outcome, binary logistic regression with a dichotomized mRS (0–1/2–6, 0–2/3–6, and 0–4/5–6), and proportional odds logistic regression with the ordinal mRS. The statistical power of the 3 approaches was expressed as the proportion of 10\,000 simulations that resulted in a statistically significant treatment effect (P≤0.05).Results—The mean utility values (SD) for mRS categories 0 to 6 were: 0.95 (0.08), 0.93 (0.13), 0.83 (0.21), 0.62 (0.27), 0.42 (0.28), 0.11 (0.28), and 0 (0), respectively, but varied substantially between individual patients within each category. The UW-mRS approach was more efficient than the dichotomous approach (power 85\% versus 71\%) but less efficient than the ordinal approach (power 85\% versus 87\%).Conclusions—The UW-mRS as primary outcome does not capture individual variation in utility values and may reduce the statistical power of a randomized trial.}

  abstract     = {Composite endpoints are frequently used in clinical trials, but simple approaches, such as the time to first event, do not reflect any ordering among the endpoints. However, some endpoints, such as mortality, are worse than others. A variety of procedures have been proposed to reflect the severity of the individual endpoints such as pairwise ranking approaches, the win ratio, and the desirability of outcome ranking. When patients have different lengths of follow-up, however, ranking can be difficult and proposed methods do not naturally lead to regression approaches and require specialized software. This paper defines an ordering score O to operationalize the patient ranking implied by hierarchical endpoints. We show how differential right censoring of follow-up corresponds to multiple interval censoring of the ordering score allowing standard software for survival models to be used to calculate the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators (NPMLEs) of different measures. Additionally, if one assumes that the ordering score is transformable to an exponential random variable, a semiparametric regression is obtained, which is equivalent to the proportional hazards model subject to multiple interval censoring. Standard software can be used for estimation. We show that the NPMLE can be poorly behaved compared to the simple estimators in staggered entry trials. We also show that the semiparametric estimator can be more efficient than simple estimators and explore how standard Cox regression maneuvers can be used to assess model fit, allow for flexible generalizations, and assess interactions of covariates with treatment. We analyze a trial of short versus long-term antiplatelet therapy using our methods.},

  abstract     = {In randomized clinical trials, power can be greatly increased and sample size reduced by using an ordinal outcome instead of a binary one. The proportional odds model is the most popular model for analyzing ordinal outcomes, and it borrows treatment effect information across outcome levels to obtain a single overall treatment effect as an odds ratio. When deaths can occur, it is logical to have death as one of the ordinal categories. Consumers of the results frequently seek evidence of a mortality reduction even though they were not willing to fund a study large enough to be able to detect this with decent power. The same goes when assessing whether there is an increase in mortality, indicating a severe safety problem for the new treatment. The partial proportional odds model provides a continuous bridge between standalone evidence for a mortality effect and obtaining evidence using statistically richer information on the combination of nonfatal and fatal endpoints. A simulation demonstrates the relationship between the amount of borrowing of treatment effect across outcome levels and the Bayesian power for finding evidence for a mortality reduction.},

  abstract     = {Ordinal scales are frequently used in clinical trials to quantify outcomes which are non-dimensional. They may be regarded as either single state or transition measures based on whether they assess the outcome at a single point in time or directly examine change which has occurred between two points in time. Each has unique structural and operating characteristics, so that different methodological standards for their construction and utilisation are required. All trials employing ordinal scales published in three leading journals between 1980 and 1984 were examined. For both types of scales the individual ranks must be clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and ordered in a hierarchical progression. Further, both types must be able to detect equally both improvement and deterioration. For this to be ensured with the single state scales the population under study must not be clustered at one extreme of the scale at entry into the trial. With the transition scales internal symmetry must be achieved. Strategies for determining the comparisons to be performed should include emphasis on within patient analysis for crossover trials. Concordance between scale scores and the other measures of outcome employed in the trial must be evaluated. Frequent violations were uncovered in the studies reviewed, and it is hoped that the simple rules outlined will prove useful in the planning and evaluation of future trials.}

However, the SOFA score is not adjusted for age and therefore not suitable for children.To adapt and validate a pediatric version of the SOFA score (pSOFA) in critically ill children and to evaluate the Sepsis-3 definitions in patients with confirmed or suspected infection.This retrospective observational cohort study included all critically ill children 21 years or younger admitted to a 20-bed, multidisciplinary, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2016. Data on these children were obtained from an electronic health record database. The pSOFA score was developed by adapting the original SOFA score with age-adjusted cutoffs for the cardiovascular and renal systems and by expanding the respiratory criteria to include noninvasive surrogates of lung injury. Daily pSOFA scores were calculated from admission until day 28 of hospitalization, discharge, or death (whichever came first). Three additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were calculated for comparison.Organ dysfunction measured by the pSOFA score, and sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions.The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The daily pSOFA scores and additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were compared. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve. The pSOFA score was then used to assess the Sepsis-3 definitions in the subgroup of children with confirmed or suspected infection.In all, 6303 patients with 8711 encounters met inclusion criteria. Each encounter was treated independently. Of the 8482 survivors of hospital encounters, 4644 (54.7\%) were male and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69 (17-156) months. Among the 229 nonsurvivors, 127 (55.4\%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 43 (8-144) months. In-hospital mortality was 2.6\%. The maximum pSOFA score had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.94 (95\% CI, 0.92-0.95). The pSOFA score had a similar or better performance than other pediatric organ dysfunction scores. According to the Sepsis-3 definitions, 1231 patients (14.1\%) were classified as having sepsis and had a mortality rate of 12.1\%, and 347 (4.0\%) had septic shock and a mortality rate of 32.3\%. Patients with sepsis were more likely to die than patients with confirmed or suspected infection but no sepsis (odds ratio, 18; 95\% CI, 11-28). Of the 229 patients who died during their hospitalization, 149 (65.0\%) had sepsis or septic shock during their course.The pSOFA score was adapted and validated with age-adjusted variables in critically ill children. Using the pSOFA score, the Sepsis-3 definitions were assessed in children with confirmed or suspected infection. This study is the first assessment, to date, of the Sepsis-3 definitions in critically ill children. Use of these definitions in children is feasible and shows promising results.}

Data Sources:~           We used a previously published database of pediatric critical care randomized controlled trials (PICUtrials.net) derived from searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CENTRAL.           Study Selection:~           We included randomized controlled trials of interventions to children admitted to a PICU with septic or dengue hemorrhagic shock which were published in English.           Data Extraction:~           Study characteristics and outcomes were retrieved by two independent reviewers with disagreement being resolved by a third reviewer. We defined feasibility as 1) recruitment of at least 90\% of the targeted sample size and agreement of the observed outcome rate in the control group with the rate used for the sample size calculation to within 10\% or 2) finding of a statistically significant difference in an interim or final analysis.           Data Synthesis:~           Nineteen of 321 identified articles were selected for review. Fourteen of 19 studies (74\%) provided an a priori definition of their primary outcome measure in their “Methods section.” Mortality rate was the most commonly reported primary outcome (8/14; 57\%), followed by duration of shock (4/14; 29\%) followed by organ failure (1/14; 7\%). Only three of 19 included trials met feasibility criteria.           Conclusions:~           Our review found that use of mortality alone as a primary outcome in pediatric septic shock trials was associated with significant limitations and that long-term patient-centered outcomes were not used in this setting. Composite outcomes incorporating mortality and long-term outcomes should be explored for use in future pediatric septic shock trials.},

Given predictor variable X and outcome variable Y, we may estimate DYX as a measure of the effect of X on Y, or we may estimate DXY as a performance indicator of X as a predictor of Y. The somersd package allows the estimation of Somers’ D and Kendall's τA with confidence limits as well as p-values. The Stata 9 version of somersd can estimate extended versions of Somers’ D not previously available, including the Gini index, the parameter tested by the sign test, and extensions to left- or right-censored data. It can also estimate stratified versions of Somers’ D, restricted to pairs in the same stratum. Therefore, it is possible to define strata by grouping values of a confounder, or of a propensity score based on multiple confounders, and to estimate versions of Somers’ D that measure the association between the outcome and the predictor, adjusted for the confounders. The Stata 9 version of somersd uses the Mata language for improved computational efficiency with large datasets.},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE. Our goal was to describe patient and hospital characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and charges for critically ill children with severe sepsis.METHODS. Our study consisted of a retrospective study of children 0 to 19 years of age hospitalized with severe sepsis using the 2003 Kids' Inpatient Database. We generated national estimates of rates of hospitalization and then compared in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and total charges according to patient and hospital characteristics using multivariable regression methods. Severity of illness was measured by using all-patient refined diagnosis-related group severity of illness classification into minor, moderate, major, and extreme severity.RESULTS. There were an estimated 21448 hospitalizations for severe pediatric sepsis nationally in 2003. The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.2\%. Comorbid illness was present in 34\% of hospitalized children. Most (70\%) of the extremely ill children were admitted to children's hospitals. Length of stay was longer among patients with higher illness severity and nonsurvivors compared with survivors (13.5 vs 8.5 days). Hospitalizations at urban or children's hospitals were also associated with longer length of stay than nonchildren's or rural hospitals, respectively. Higher charges were associated with higher illness severity, and nonsurvivors had 2.5-fold higher total charges than survivors. Also, higher charges were observed among hospitalizations in urban or children's hospitals. In multivariable regression analysis, multiple comorbid illnesses, multiple organ dysfunction, and greater severity of illness were associated with higher odds of mortality and longer length of stay. Higher hospital charges and longer length of stay were observed among transfer hospitalizations and among hospitalizations to children's hospitals and nonchildren's teaching hospitals compared with hospitals, which had neither children's nor teaching status.CONCLUSIONS. Mortality from severe pediatric sepsis is associated with patient illness severity, comorbid illness, and multiple organ dysfunction. Many characteristics are associated with resource consumption, including type of hospital, source of admission, and illness severity.}

  abstract     = {Background/aims The Food and Drug Administration recommends research into developing well-defined and reliable endpoints to evaluate treatments for severe influenza requiring hospitalization. A novel 6-category ordinal endpoint of patient health status after 7 days that ranges from death to hospital discharge with resumption of normal activities is being used in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for severe influenza (FLU-IVIG). We compare the power of the ordinal endpoint under a proportional odds model to other types of endpoints as a function of various trial parameters. Methods We used closed-form analysis and empirical simulation to compare the power of the ordinal endpoint to time-to-event, longitudinal, and binary endpoints. In the simulation setting, we varied the treatment effect and the distribution of the placebo group across the follow-up period with consideration of adjustment for baseline health status. Results In the analytic setting, ordinal endpoints of high granularity provided greater power than time-to-event endpoints when most patients in the placebo group had either naturally progressed to the category of hospital discharge by day 7 or were far from hospital discharge on day 7. In the simulation setting, adjustment for baseline health status universally raised power for the proportional odds model. Across different placebo group distributions of the ordinal endpoint regardless of adjustment for baseline health status, only time-to-event endpoints yielded higher power than the ordinal endpoint for certain treatment effects. Conclusions In this case study, the FLU-IVIG ordinal endpoint provided greater power than time-to-event, binary, and longitudinal endpoints for most scenarios of the treatment effect and placebo group distribution, including the target population studied for FLU-IVIG. The ordinal endpoint was only surpassed by the time-to-event endpoint when many patients in the placebo group were on the cusp of hospital discharge on day 7 and the follow-up period for the time-to-event endpoint was extended to allow for additional events. Our general approach for evaluating the power of several potential endpoints for an influenza trial can be used for designing other influenza trials with different target populations and for other trials in other disease areas.},

We advocate that researchers use ordinal transition models to analyze ordinal longitudinal outcomes when appropriate alongside standard methods such as time-to-event modeling.},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE To derive and validate novel criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock across differently resourced settings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, international, retrospective cohort study in 10 health systems in the US, Colombia, Bangladesh, China, and Kenya, 3 of which were used as external validation sites. Data were collected from emergency and inpatient encounters for children (aged {$<$}18 years) from 2010 to 2019: 3 049 699 in the development (including derivation and internal validation) set and 581 317 in the external validation set. EXPOSURE Stacked regression models to predict mortality in children with suspected infection were derived and validated using the best-performing organ dysfunction subscores from 8 existing scores. The final model was then translated into an integer-based score used to establish binary criteria for sepsis and septic shock. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome for all analyses was in-hospital mortality. Model- and integer-based score performance measures included the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC; primary) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC; secondary). For binary criteria, primary performance measures were positive predictive value and sensitivity. RESULTS Among the 172 984 children with suspected infection in the first 24 hours (development set; 1.2\% mortality), a 4-organ-system model performed best. The integer version of that model, the Phoenix Sepsis Score, had AUPRCs of 0.23 to 0.38 (95\% CI range, 0.20-0.39) and AUROCs of 0.71 to 0.92 (95\% CI range, 0.70-0.92) to predict mortality in the validation sets. Using a Phoenix Sepsis Score of 2 points or higher in children with suspected infection as criteria for sepsis and sepsis plus 1 or more cardiovascular point as criteria for septic shock resulted in a higher positive predictive value and higher or similar sensitivity compared with the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC) criteria across differently resourced settings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The novel Phoenix sepsis criteria, which were derived and validated using data from higher- and lower-resource settings, had improved performance for the diagnosis of pediatric sepsis and septic shock compared with the existing IPSCC criteria.},

  abstract     = {Importance               Sepsis is a leading cause of death among children worldwide. Current pediatric-specific criteria for sepsis were published in 2005 based on expert opinion. In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, but it excluded children.                                         Objective               To update and evaluate criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children.                                         Evidence Review               The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) convened a task force of 35 pediatric experts in critical care, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, general pediatrics, nursing, public health, and neonatology from 6 continents. Using evidence from an international survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and a new organ dysfunction score developed based on more than 3 million electronic health record encounters from 10 sites on 4 continents, a modified Delphi consensus process was employed to develop criteria.                                         Findings                                Based on survey data, most pediatric clinicians used                 sepsis                 to refer to infection with life-threatening organ dysfunction, which differed from prior pediatric sepsis criteria that used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which have poor predictive properties, and included the redundant term,                 severe sepsis                 . The SCCM task force recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Children with a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points had in-hospital mortality of 7.1\% in higher-resource settings and 28.5\% in lower-resource settings, more than 8 times that of children with suspected infection not meeting these criteria. Mortality was higher in children who had organ dysfunction in at least 1 of 4—respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological—organ systems that was not the primary site of infection.                 Septic shock                 was defined as children with sepsis who had cardiovascular dysfunction, indicated by at least 1 cardiovascular point in the Phoenix Sepsis Score, which included severe hypotension for age, blood lactate exceeding 5 mmol/L, or need for vasoactive medication. Children with septic shock had an in-hospital mortality rate of 10.8\% and 33.5\% in higher- and lower-resource settings, respectively.                                                        Conclusions and Relevance               The Phoenix sepsis criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children were derived and validated by the international SCCM Pediatric Sepsis Definition Task Force using a large international database and survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and modified Delphi consensus approach. A Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 identified potentially life-threatening organ dysfunction in children younger than 18 years with infection, and its use has the potential to improve clinical care, epidemiological assessment, and research in pediatric sepsis and septic shock around the world.},

Conclusions:~           Pediatric oncology patients account for a relatively high proportion of severe sepsis in children. Available data suggest that outcomes among the non-HSCT oncology population are not substantially different from that of the general population. Data suggest that children with cancer (non-HSCT) who survive their septic episode will have a high probability of 6-month survival. In light of these findings, pediatric oncology patients are an important source of potential candidates for clinical trials of sepsis. In addition, HSCT patients seem to have significantly worse outcomes from sepsis than the non-HSCT oncology population, and thus, their participation in clinical trials is needed. However, in view of these worse outcomes, it is important to stratify the randomization for this population and to ensure that studies are adequately powered to assess outcomes in this subgroup.},

Mortality may not be an adequate measure of outcome if it is reduced at the cost of increased disability. No neonatal organ dysfunction score has yet been validated as a reliable surrogate for disability-free survival. To validate a score as a surrogate would require randomized trials showing 1) a causal connection between change in the score and change in disability-free survival and 2) that the score fully captured all the effects of treatment on disability-free survival. Neonatal illness severity scores provide a convenient, but imperfect, tool to adjust for risk of sepsis in observational studies. They can help to stratify infants by risk of sepsis at entry to trials, allowing analyses of outcome in predefined subgroups. However, they cannot circumvent the need for randomized trials of adequate size in neonatal sepsis, which address disability-free survival as the primary outcome.},

Accumulating work in this area has identified the need for general guidance on the development of core outcome sets.

Establishing concept validity through empirical validation is not only problematic, but also time consuming.

Design Qualitative synthesis combining parent interview data from the Fluids in Shock (FiSh) and Fever feasibility studies. Parents had experience of their child being admitted to a UK emergency department or intensive care unit with a suspected infection. Participants n=: 85 parents. FiSh study: n=41 parents, 37 mothers, 4 fathers, 7 were bereaved. Fever study: n=44 parents, 33 mothers, 11 fathers, 7 were bereaved. Results In addition to survival, parents prioritised short-term outcomes including: organ and physiological functioning (eg, heart rate, breathing rate and temperature); their child looking and/or behaving more like their normal self; and length of time on treatments or mechanical support. Longer term prioritised outcomes included effects of illness on child health and development. We found that parents’ prioritisation of outcomes was influenced by their experience of their child’s illness, survival and the point at which they are asked about outcomes of importance in the course of their child’s illness. Conclusions Findings provide insight into parent prioritised outcomes to inform the design of future trials investigating treatments for paediatric suspected or proven severe infection as well as core outcome set development work.},

In the context of parallel-group randomized trials, we quantify treatment effects by the probability that a subject in the treatment group has a better score than (or a win over) a subject in the control group. Asymptotic parametric and nonparametric confidence intervals for this win probability and associated sample size formulas are derived for studies with only follow-up scores, and those with both baseline and follow-up measurements. We assessed the performance of both the parametric and nonparametric approaches using simulation studies based on real studies with Likert item and Likert scale data. The simulation results demonstrate that even without baseline adjustment, the parametric methods did not perform well, in terms of bias, interval coverage percentage, balance of tail error, and assurance of achieving a pre-specified precision. In contrast, the nonparametric approach performed very well for both the unadjusted and adjusted win probability. We illustrate the methods with two examples: one using Likert item data and the other using Like scale data. We conclude that non-parametric methods are preferable for two-group randomization trials with Likert data. Illustrative SAS code for the nonparametric approach using existing procedures is provided.},

  abstract     = {Background Desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) outcomes, with or without response adjusted for antibiotic risk (RADAR), are increasingly used in infectious diseases randomized clinical trials (RCTs), with the advantage of being able to combine multiple clinical outcomes and antibiotic duration in a single metric. However, it remains poorly understood, and there is considerable heterogeneity in its use. Objectives In this scoping review, we explain how to design, use and analyse a DOOR endpoint, and highlight several pitfalls and potential improvements that can be made to DOOR/RADAR. Sources The Ovid MEDLINE database was searched for terms related to DOOR in English-language articles published up to 31 December 2022. Articles discussing DOOR methodology and/or reporting clinical trial analyses (as either primary, secondary, or post-hoc analysis) using a DOOR outcome were included. Content Seventeen articles were included in the final review, of which nine reported DOOR analyses of 12 RCTs. Eight articles discussed DOOR methodology. We synthesised information from these articles and discuss (a) how to develop a DOOR scale, (b) how to conduct a DOOR/RADAR analysis, (c) use in clinical trials, (d) use of alternative tiebreakers apart from RADAR, (e) partial credit analyses, and (f) criticisms and pitfalls of DOOR/RADAR. Implications DOOR is an important innovation for RCTs in infectious diseases. We highlight potential areas of methodological improvement for future research. There remains considerable heterogeneity in its implementation, and further collaborative efforts, with a more diverse range of perspectives, should be made to develop consensus scales for use in prospective studies.},

  abstract     = {Several authors have recommended adopting the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) or mean ridit as an effect size, arguing that it measures an important and interpretable type of effect that conventional effect-size measures do not. It is base-rate insensitive, robust to outliers, and invariant under order-preserving transformations. However, applications have been limited to group comparisons, and usually just two groups, in line with the popular interpretation of the AUC as measuring the probability that a randomly chosen case from one group will score higher on the dependent variable than a randomly chosen case from another group. This tutorial article shows that the AUC can be used as an effect size for both categorical and continuous predictors in a wide variety of general linear models, whose dependent variables may be ordinal, interval, or ratio level. Thus, the AUC is a general effect-size measure. Demonstrations in this article include linear regression, ordinal logistic regression, gamma regression, and beta regression. The online supplemental materials to this tutorial provide a survey of currently available software resources in R for the AUC and ridits, along with the code and access to the data used in the examples.

Confidence intervals for these are demonstrated using the somersd package. It is argued that confidence limits for these parameters, and their differences, are more informative than the traditional practice of reporting only p-values. These three parameters are also important in defining other tests and parameters, such as the Wilcoxon test, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Harrell's C, and the Theil median slope.}

  abstract     = {The win ratio was introduced into cardiovascular trials as a potentially better way of analyzing composite endpoints to account for the hierarchy of clinical significance of their components and to facilitate the inclusion of recurrent events. The basic concept of the win ratio is to define a hierarchy of clinical importance within the components of the composite outcome, form all possible pairs by comparing every subject in the treatment group with every subject in the control group, and then evaluate each pair for the occurrence of the components of the composite outcome in descending order of importance, starting at the most important and progressing down the hierarchy if the outcome does not result in a win in either pair until pairs are tied for the outcome after exhaustion of all components. Although the win ratio offers a novel method of depiction of outcomes in clinical trials, its advantages may be counterbalanced by several fallacies (such as ignoring ties and weighting each hierarchal component equally) and challenges in appropriate clinical interpretation (establishing clinical meaningfulness of the observed effect size). From this perspective, we discuss these and other fallacies and provide a suggested framework to overcome such limitations to enhance utility of this statistical method across the clinical trial enterprise.},

The measure applies directly to normal linear models and to a normal latent variable model for ordinal response variables. It equals  for the corresponding ordinal model that applies a probit link function to cumulative multinomial probabilities, for standard normal cdf  and effect  that is the coefficient of the group indicator variable. For the more general latent variable model for ordinal responses that corresponds to a linear model with other possible error distributions and corresponding link functions for cumulative multinomial probabilities, the ordinal superiority measure equals  with the log–log link and equals approximately  with the logit link, where  is the group effect. Another ordinal superiority measure generalizes the difference of proportions from binary to ordinal responses.

  abstract     = {An adaptive platform trial (APT) offers the ability to incorporate several research questions in the same target population across multiple domains (interventions), with the ability to add new questions in a perpetual manner. An APT is particularly appealing for pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT); an area of high heterogeneity, limited trial availability, and high mortality. Ideally, all domains in an APT would have the same primary endpoint. Therefore, an ordinal endpoint with multiple categories that combines various clinical outcomes into a single outcome measure is particularly appealing for APTs. Unfortunately, there is no accepted ordinal endpoint for pediatric HCT trials. This article aims to describe the methodology used to co-design a novel primary ordinal endpoint for the pediatric HCT APT — BANDICOOT. BANDICOOT is a study that aims to build an adaptive novel platform design — improving the complications, cost-effectiveness, outcomes, and overall survival from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.The results of this process identified two potential ordinal endpoints that could be used, one focusing on organ support and the other on a combination of organ support, viral reactivation, and immune reconstitution. We explored the data extraction required for these endpoints from electronic medical records that we will utilize to validate the endpoints and determine which will be used in the APT BANDICOOT. In an era in which APTs are becoming increasingly utilized to answer important questions in clinical care, this article describes a reproducible strategy for the design of high-quality and meaningful ordinal endpoints.},

  abstract     = {In the future, clinical trials will have an increased emphasis on pragmatism, providing a practical description of the effects of new treatments in realistic clinical settings. Accomplishing pragmatism requires better summaries of the totality of the evidence in ways that clinical trials consumers—patients, physicians, insurers—find transparent and allow for informed benefit:risk decision-making. The current approach to the analysis of clinical trials is to analyze efficacy and safety separately and then combine these analyses into a benefit:risk assessment. Many assume that this will effectively describe the impact on patients. But this approach is suboptimal for evaluating the totality of effects on patients. We discuss methods for benefit:risk assessment that have greater pragmatism than methods that separately analyze efficacy and safety. These include the concepts of within-patient analyses and composite benefit:risk endpoints with a goal of understanding how to analyze one patient before trying to figure out how to analyze many. We discuss the desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) and introduce the partial credit strategy using an example in a clinical trial evaluating the effects of a new antibiotic. As part of the example, we introduce a strategy to engage patients as a resource to inform benefit:risk analyses consistent with the goal of measuring and weighing outcomes that are most important from the patient's perspective. We describe a broad vision for the future of clinical trials consistent with increased pragmatism. Greater focus on using endpoints to analyze patients rather than patients to analyze endpoints particularly in late-phase/stage clinical trials is an important part of this vision.},

Specifically, it focuses on the limitations of a conventional composite outcome; how does the win ratio work, what does it mean, and how to display its findings; guidance on choosing an appropriate clinical hierarchy of outcomes including clinical events, quantitative outcomes, and other options; the additional value of the win difference as a measure of absolute benefit: extension to stratified win ratio, subgroup analysis, matched win ratio, and covariate adjustment; determining trial size for a win ratio outcome; specific insights such as adaptive designs, use of repeat events, and use of margins and time averages for quantitative outcomes; a critique of potential misuses; availability of statistical software; and a statistical appendix on the methodological details. Throughout, each principle is illustrated by examples from specific cardiology trials. The article concludes with a set of recommendations for future use of the win ratio.}

An important limitation of these statistics is their inability to adjust for covariates other than by stratified analysis. Because the win ratio does not account for ties, the win odds, a modification that includes ties, has attracted attention. We review and combine information on the win odds to articulate the statistical inferences for the win odds. We also show alternative variance estimators based on the exact permutation and bootstrap as well as statistical inference via the probabilistic index. Finally, we extend multiple-covariate regression probabilistic index models to the win odds with a univariate outcome. As an illustration we apply the regression models to the data in the CHARM trial.},

An “ordinal superiority” measure summarizes the probability that an observation from one distribution falls above an independent observation from the other distribution, adjusted for explanatory variables in a model. The measure applies directly to normal linear models and to a normal latent variable model for ordinal response variables. It equals  for the corresponding ordinal model that applies a probit link function to cumulative multinomial probabilities, for standard normal cdf  and effect  that is the coefficient of the group indicator variable. For the more general latent variable model for ordinal responses that corresponds to a linear model with other possible error distributions and corresponding link functions for cumulative multinomial probabilities, the ordinal superiority measure equals  with the log–log link and equals approximately  with the logit link, where  is the group effect. Another ordinal superiority measure generalizes the difference of proportions from binary to ordinal responses. We also present related measures directly for ordinal models for the observed response that need not assume corresponding latent response models. We present confidence intervals for the measures and illustrate with an example.}

In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models.

  abstract     = {This paper describes the methodologies used to develop a prediction model to assist health workers in developing countries in facing one of the most difficult health problems in all parts of the world: the presentation of an acutely ill young infant. Statistical approaches for developing the clinical prediction model faced at least two major difficulties. First, the number of predictor variables, especially clinical signs and symptoms, is very large, necessitating the use of data reduction techniques that are blinded to the outcome. Second, there is no uniquely accepted continuous outcome measure or final binary diagnostic criterion. For example, the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is ill-defined. Clinical decision makers must identify infants likely to have positive cultures as well as to grade the severity of illness. In the WHO/ARI Young Infant Multicentre Study we have found an ordinal outcome scale made up of a mixture of laboratory and diagnostic markers to have several clinical advantages as well as to increase the power of tests for risk factors. Such a mixed ordinal scale does present statistical challenges because it may violate constant slope assumptions of ordinal regression models. In this paper we develop and validate an ordinal predictive model after choosing a data reduction technique. We show how ordinality of the outcome is checked against each predictor. We describe new but simple techniques for graphically examining residuals from ordinal logistic models to detect problems with variable transformations as well as to detect non-proportional odds and other lack of fit. We examine an alternative type of ordinal logistic model, the continuation ratio model, to determine if it provides a better fit. We find that it does not but that this model is easily modified to allow the regression coefficients to vary with cut-offs of the response variable. Complex terms in this extended model are penalized to allow only as much complexity as the data will support. We approximate the extended continuation ratio model with a model with fewer terms to allow us to draw a nomogram for obtaining various predictions. The model is validated for calibration and discrimination using the bootstrap. We apply much of the modelling strategy described in Harrell, Lee and Mark (Statist. Med. 15, 361–387 (1998)) for survival analysis, adapting it to ordinal logistic regression and further emphasizing penalized maximum likelihood estimation and data reduction. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract     = {The cumulative logit or the proportional odds regression model is commonly used to study covariate effects on ordinal responses. This paper provides some graphical and numerical methods for checking the adequacy of the proportional odds regression model. The methods focus on evaluating functional misspecification for specific covariate effects, but misspecification of the link function can also be dealt with under the same framework. For the logistic regression model with binary responses, Arbogast and Lin (Statist. Med. 2005; 24:229–247) developed similar graphical and numerical methods for assessing the adequacy of the model using the cumulative sums of residuals. The paper generalizes their methods to ordinal responses and illustrates them using an example from the VA Normative Aging Study. Simulation studies comparing the performance of the different diagnostic methods indicate that some of the graphical methods are more powerful in detecting model misspecification than the Hosmer–Lemeshow-type goodness-of-fit statistics for the class of models studied.

  abstract     = {Ordinal outcomes are common in scientific research and everyday practice, and we often rely on regression models to make inference. A long-standing problem with such regression analyses is the lack of effective diagnostic tools for validating model assumptions. The difficulty arises from the fact that an ordinal variable has discrete values that are labeled with, but not, numerical values. The values merely represent ordered categories. In this article, we propose a surrogate approach to defining residuals for an ordinal outcome Y. The idea is to define a continuous variable S as a “surrogate” of Y and then obtain residuals based on S. For the general class of cumulative link regression models, we study the residual’s theoretical and graphical properties. We show that the residual has null properties similar to those of the common residuals for continuous outcomes. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the residual has power to detect misspecification with respect to (1) mean structures; (2) link functions; (3) heteroscedasticity; (4) proportionality; and (5) mixed populations. The proposed residual also enables us to develop numeric measures for goodness of fit using classical distance notions. Our results suggest that compared to a previously defined residual, our residual can reveal deeper insights into model diagnostics. We stress that this work focuses on residual analysis, rather than hypothesis testing. The latter has limited utility as it only provides a single p-value, whereas our residual can reveal what components of the model are misspecified and advise how to make improvements.

This view on ordinal models allows to derive a taxonomy of models that includes basic ordinal regression models, models with more complex parameterizations, the class of hierarchically structured models, and the more recently developed finite mixture models. The structured overview that is given covers existing models and shows how models can be extended to account for further effects of explanatory variables. Particular attention is given to the modeling of additional heterogeneity as, for example, dispersion effects. The modeling is embedded into the framework of response styles and the exact meaning of heterogeneity terms in ordinal models is investigated. It is shown that the meaning of terms is crucially determined by the type of model that is used. Moreover, it is demonstrated how models with a complex category-specific effect structure can be simplified to obtain simpler models that fit sufficiently well. The fitting of models is illustrated by use of a real data set, and a short overview of existing software is given.

A model is proposed that explicitly links varying dispersion to explanatory variables. It is able to explain why frequently some variables are found to have category-specific effects. The embedding into the framework of multivariate generalized linear models allows to use computational tools and asymptotic results that have been developed for this class of models.

A major strength of gologit2 is that it can fit three special cases of the generalized model: the proportional odds/parallel-lines model, the partial proportional odds model, and the logistic regression model. Hence, gologit2 can fit models that are less restrictive than the parallel-lines models fitted by ologit (whose assumptions are often violated) but more parsimonious and interpretable than those fitted by a nonordinal method, such as multinomial logistic regression (i.e., mlogit). Other key advantages of gologit2 include support for linear constraints, survey data estimation, and the computation of estimated probabilities via the predict command.}

Largely ignored in these discussions are methods for ordinal variables that are natural extensions of probit and logit models for dichotomous variables. If ordinal variables are discrete realizations of unmeasured continuous variables, these methods allow one to include ordinal dependent and independent variables into structural equation models in a way that (1) explicitly recognizes their ordinality, (2) avoids arbitrary assumptions about their scale, and (3) allows for analysis of continuous, dichotomous, and ordinal variables within a common statistical framework. These models rely on assumed probability distributions of the continuous variables that underly the observed ordinal variables, but these assumptions are testable. The models can be estimated using a number of commonly used statistical programs. As is illustrated by an empirical example, ordered probit and logit models, like their dichotomous counterparts, take account of the ceiling and floor restrictions on models that include ordinal variables, whereas the linear regression model does not.}

We restrict our discussion to studies with two groups: one with n patients receiving a new treatment and the other with m patients receiving the usual or no treatment. The standardized mean difference (e.g. Cohen's d) is a well-known index for continuous outcomes. There is some intuitive value to d, but measuring improvement in standard deviations (SD) is a statistical concept that may not help a clinician. How much improvement is a half SD? A more intuitive and simple-to-calculate ES is the probability that the response of a patient given the new treatment (X) is better than the one for a randomly chosen patient given the old or no treatment (Y) (i.e. P(X {$>$} Y), larger values meaning better outcomes). This probability has an immediate identity with the area under the curve (AUC) measure in procedures for receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve comparing responses to two treatments. It also can be easily calculated from the Mann–Whitney U, Wilcoxon, or Kendall τ statistics. We describe the characteristics of an ideal ES.

RESULTS A total of 3 999 528 (female, 47.3\%) ED visits were included. pSOFA scores ranged from 0 to 16, with 126 250 visits (3.2\%) having a pSOFA score of 2 or more. pSOFA scores of 2 or more had sensitivity of 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.62-0.67) and specificity of 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.97-0.97), with negative predictive value of 1.0 (95\% CI, 1.00-1.00) in predicting hospital mortality. Of 642 868 patients with suspected infection (16.1\%), 42 992 (6.7\%) met criteria for sepsis, and 374 (0.1\%) met criteria for septic shock. Hospital mortality rates for suspected infection (599 502), sepsis (42 992), and septic shock (374) were 0.0\%, 0.9\%, and 8.0\%, respectively. The pSOFA score had similar discrimination for hospital mortality in all ED visits (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.82) and the subset with suspected infection (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large, multicenter study of pediatric ED visits, a pSOFA score of 2 or more was uncommon and associated with increased hospital mortality yet had poor sensitivity as a screening tool for hospital mortality. Conversely, children with a pSOFA score of 2 or less were at very low risk of death, with high specificity and negative predictive value. Among patients with suspected infection, patients with pSOFA-defined septic shock demonstrated the highest mortality.},

To critically evaluate and use trial results, readers require complete and transparent information regarding what was planned, done, and found. Specific and harmonized guidance as to what outcome-specific information should be reported in publications of clinical trials is needed to reduce deficient reporting practices that obscure issues with outcome selection, assessment, and analysis.To develop harmonized, evidence- and consensus-based standards for reporting outcomes in clinical trial reports through integration with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement.Using the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) methodological framework, the CONSORT-Outcomes 2022 extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement was developed by (1) generation and evaluation of candidate outcome reporting items via consultation with experts and a scoping review of existing guidance for reporting trial outcomes (published within the 10 years prior to March 19, 2018) identified through expert solicitation, electronic database searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Methodology Register, gray literature searches, and reference list searches; (2) a 3-round international Delphi voting process (November 2018-February 2019) completed by 124 panelists from 22 countries to rate and identify additional items; and (3) an in-person consensus meeting (April 9-10, 2019) attended by 25 panelists to identify essential items for the reporting of outcomes in clinical trial reports.The scoping review and consultation with experts identified 128 recommendations relevant to reporting outcomes in trial reports, the majority (83\%) of which were not included in the CONSORT 2010 statement. All recommendations were consolidated into 64 items for Delphi voting; after the Delphi survey process, 30 items met criteria for further evaluation at the consensus meeting and possible inclusion in the CONSORT-Outcomes 2022 extension. The discussions during and after the consensus meeting yielded 17 items that elaborate on the CONSORT 2010 statement checklist items and are related to completely defining and justifying the trial outcomes, including how and when they were assessed (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 6a), defining and justifying the target difference between treatment groups during sample size calculations (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 7a), describing the statistical methods used to compare groups for the primary and secondary outcomes (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 12a), and describing the prespecified analyses and any outcome analyses not prespecified (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 18).This CONSORT-Outcomes 2022 extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement provides 17 outcome-specific items that should be addressed in all published clinical trial reports and may help increase trial utility, replicability, and transparency and may minimize the risk of selective nonreporting of trial results.}

  abstract     = {Background and Purpose—Although the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used primary end point in acute stroke trials, its power is limited when analyzed in dichotomized fashion and its indication of effect size challenging to interpret when analyzed ordinally. Weighting the 7 Rankin levels by utilities may improve scale interpretability while preserving statistical power.Methods—A utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) was derived by averaging values from time-tradeoff (patient centered) and person-tradeoff (clinician centered) studies. The UW-mRS, standard ordinal mRS, and dichotomized mRS were applied to 11 trials or meta-analyses of acute stroke treatments, including lytic, endovascular reperfusion, blood pressure moderation, and hemicraniectomy interventions.Results—Utility values were 1.0 for mRS level 0; 0.91 for mRS level 1; 0.76 for mRS level 2; 0.65 for mRS level 3; 0.33 for mRS level 4; 0 for mRS level 5; and 0 for mRS level 6. For trials with unidirectional treatment effects, the UW-mRS paralleled the ordinal mRS and outperformed dichotomous mRS analyses. Both the UW-mRS and the ordinal mRS were statistically significant in 6 of 8 unidirectional effect trials, whereas dichotomous analyses were statistically significant in 2 to 4 of 8. In bidirectional effect trials, both the UW-mRS and ordinal tests captured the divergent treatment effects by showing neutral results, whereas some dichotomized analyses showed positive results. Mean utility differences in trials with statistically significant positive results ranged from 0.026 to 0.249.Conclusions—A UW-mRS performs similar to the standard ordinal mRS in detecting treatment effects in actual stroke trials and ensures the quantitative outcome is a valid reflection of patient-centered benefits.}

  abstract     = {Background and Purpose—The utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (UW-mRS) has been proposed as a new patient-centered primary outcome in stroke trials. We aimed to describe utility weights for the mRS health states and to evaluate the statistical efficiency of the UW-mRS to detect treatment effects in stroke intervention trials.Methods—We used data of the 500 patients enrolled in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). Utility values were elicited from the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire assessed at 90 days after inclusion, simultaneously with the mRS. Utility weights were determined by averaging the utilities of all patients within each mRS category. We performed simulations to evaluate statistical efficiency. The simulated treatment effect was an odds ratio of 1.65 in favor of the treatment arm, similar for all mRS cutoffs. This treatment effect was analyzed using 3 approaches: linear regression with the UW-mRS as outcome, binary logistic regression with a dichotomized mRS (0–1/2–6, 0–2/3–6, and 0–4/5–6), and proportional odds logistic regression with the ordinal mRS. The statistical power of the 3 approaches was expressed as the proportion of 10\,000 simulations that resulted in a statistically significant treatment effect (P≤0.05).Results—The mean utility values (SD) for mRS categories 0 to 6 were: 0.95 (0.08), 0.93 (0.13), 0.83 (0.21), 0.62 (0.27), 0.42 (0.28), 0.11 (0.28), and 0 (0), respectively, but varied substantially between individual patients within each category. The UW-mRS approach was more efficient than the dichotomous approach (power 85\% versus 71\%) but less efficient than the ordinal approach (power 85\% versus 87\%).Conclusions—The UW-mRS as primary outcome does not capture individual variation in utility values and may reduce the statistical power of a randomized trial.}

  abstract     = {Background/Aims:Standard approaches to trial design and analyses can be inefficient and non-pragmatic. Failure to consider a range of outcomes impedes evidence-based interpretation and reduces power. Traditional approaches synthesizing information obtained from separate analysis of each outcome fail to incorporate associations between outcomes and recognize the cumulative nature of outcomes in individual patients, suffer from competing risk complexities during interpretation, and since efficacy and safety analyses are often conducted on different populations, generalizability is unclear. Pragmatic and efficient approaches to trial design and analyses are needed.Methods:Approaches providing a pragmatic assessment of benefits and harms of interventions, summarizing outcomes experienced by patients, and providing sample size efficiencies are described. Ordinal outcomes recognize finer gradations of patient responses. Desirability of outcome ranking is an ordinal outcome combining benefits and harms within patients. Analysis of desirability of outcome ranking can be based on rank-based methodologies including the desirability of outcome ranking probability, the win ratio, and the proportion in favor of treatment. Partial credit analyses, involving grading the levels of the desirability of outcome ranking outcome similar to an academic test, provides an alternative approach. The methodologies are demonstrated using the acute stroke or transient ischemic attack treated with aspirin or ticagrelor and patient outcomes study (SOCRATES; NCT01994720), a randomized clinical trial.Results:Two 5-level ordinal outcomes were developed for SOCRATES. The first was based on a modified Rankin scale. The odds ratio is 0.86 (95\% confidence interval = 0.75, 0.99; p = 0.04) indicating that the odds of worse stroke categorization for a trial participant assigned to ticagrelor is 0.86 times that of a trial participant assigned to aspirin. The 5-level desirability of outcome ranking outcome incorporated and prioritized survival; the number of strokes, myocardial infarction, and major bleeding events; and whether a stroke event was disabling. The desirability of outcome ranking probability and win ratio are 0.504 (95\% confidence interval = 0.499, 0.508; p = 0.10) and 1.11 (95\% confidence interval = 0.98, 1.26; p = 0.10), respectively, implying that the probability of a more desirable result with ticagrelor is 50.4\% and that a more desirable result occurs 1.11 times more frequently on ticagrelor versus aspirin.Conclusion:Ordinal outcomes can improve efficiency through required pre-specification, careful construction, and analyses. Greater pragmatism can be obtained by composing outcomes within patients. Desirability of outcome ranking provides a global assessment of the benefits and harms that more closely reflect the experience of patients. The desirability of outcome ranking probability, the proportion in favor of treatment, the win ratio, and partial credit can more optimally inform patient treatment, enhance the understanding of the totality of intervention effects on patients, and potentially provide efficiencies over standard analyses. The methods provide the infrastructure for incorporating patient values and estimating personalized effects.},

  abstract     = {In the future, clinical trials will have an increased emphasis on pragmatism, providing a practical description of the effects of new treatments in realistic clinical settings. Accomplishing pragmatism requires better summaries of the totality of the evidence in ways that clinical trials consumers—patients, physicians, insurers—find transparent and allow for informed benefit:risk decision-making. The current approach to the analysis of clinical trials is to analyze efficacy and safety separately and then combine these analyses into a benefit:risk assessment. Many assume that this will effectively describe the impact on patients. But this approach is suboptimal for evaluating the totality of effects on patients. We discuss methods for benefit:risk assessment that have greater pragmatism than methods that separately analyze efficacy and safety. These include the concepts of within-patient analyses and composite benefit:risk endpoints with a goal of understanding how to analyze one patient before trying to figure out how to analyze many. We discuss the desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) and introduce the partial credit strategy using an example in a clinical trial evaluating the effects of a new antibiotic. As part of the example, we introduce a strategy to engage patients as a resource to inform benefit:risk analyses consistent with the goal of measuring and weighing outcomes that are most important from the patient's perspective. We describe a broad vision for the future of clinical trials consistent with increased pragmatism. Greater focus on using endpoints to analyze patients rather than patients to analyze endpoints particularly in late-phase/stage clinical trials is an important part of this vision.},

  abstract     = {Clinical trials are often designed to compare treatments on the basis of multiple outcomes. For the analysis of the treatment comparison from such a trial, in 1999, the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld test was proposed, which was a generalization of the Gehan-Wilcoxon test based on pairwise comparison of patients on a primary outcome when possible but otherwise on a secondary outcome. In 2012, Pocock and colleagues suggested an estimate based on this concept, the Win Ratio, which summarized the ratio of the number of patients who fared better versus worse on the experimental arm. However, in 2016, Oakes noted that the Win Ratio could be a function of the distribution of follow-up times of the trial. The aim of this paper is to propose an approach to representing the Win Ratio graphically in such a way that the effect of time on the estimate would be apparent. In addition, the methods are used to display the contribution of each endpoint to the composite. We apply the methods to clinical trials in cancer, cardiology, and neurology.

  abstract     = {Composite endpoints are frequently used in clinical trials, but simple approaches, such as the time to first event, do not reflect any ordering among the endpoints. However, some endpoints, such as mortality, are worse than others. A variety of procedures have been proposed to reflect the severity of the individual endpoints such as pairwise ranking approaches, the win ratio, and the desirability of outcome ranking. When patients have different lengths of follow-up, however, ranking can be difficult and proposed methods do not naturally lead to regression approaches and require specialized software. This paper defines an ordering score O to operationalize the patient ranking implied by hierarchical endpoints. We show how differential right censoring of follow-up corresponds to multiple interval censoring of the ordering score allowing standard software for survival models to be used to calculate the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators (NPMLEs) of different measures. Additionally, if one assumes that the ordering score is transformable to an exponential random variable, a semiparametric regression is obtained, which is equivalent to the proportional hazards model subject to multiple interval censoring. Standard software can be used for estimation. We show that the NPMLE can be poorly behaved compared to the simple estimators in staggered entry trials. We also show that the semiparametric estimator can be more efficient than simple estimators and explore how standard Cox regression maneuvers can be used to assess model fit, allow for flexible generalizations, and assess interactions of covariates with treatment. We analyze a trial of short versus long-term antiplatelet therapy using our methods.},

The proportional odds model is the most popular model for analyzing ordinal outcomes, and it borrows treatment effect information across outcome levels to obtain a single overall treatment effect as an odds ratio. When deaths can occur, it is logical to have death as one of the ordinal categories. Consumers of the results frequently seek evidence of a mortality reduction even though they were not willing to fund a study large enough to be able to detect this with decent power. The same goes when assessing whether there is an increase in mortality, indicating a severe safety problem for the new treatment. The partial proportional odds model provides a continuous bridge between standalone evidence for a mortality effect and obtaining evidence using statistically richer information on the combination of nonfatal and fatal endpoints. A simulation demonstrates the relationship between the amount of borrowing of treatment effect across outcome levels and the Bayesian power for finding evidence for a mortality reduction.},

They may be regarded as either single state or transition measures based on whether they assess the outcome at a single point in time or directly examine change which has occurred between two points in time. Each has unique structural and operating characteristics, so that different methodological standards for their construction and utilisation are required. All trials employing ordinal scales published in three leading journals between 1980 and 1984 were examined. For both types of scales the individual ranks must be clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and ordered in a hierarchical progression. Further, both types must be able to detect equally both improvement and deterioration. For this to be ensured with the single state scales the population under study must not be clustered at one extreme of the scale at entry into the trial. With the transition scales internal symmetry must be achieved. Strategies for determining the comparisons to be performed should include emphasis on within patient analysis for crossover trials. Concordance between scale scores and the other measures of outcome employed in the trial must be evaluated. Frequent violations were uncovered in the studies reviewed, and it is hoped that the simple rules outlined will prove useful in the planning and evaluation of future trials.}

However, the SOFA score is not adjusted for age and therefore not suitable for children.To adapt and validate a pediatric version of the SOFA score (pSOFA) in critically ill children and to evaluate the Sepsis-3 definitions in patients with confirmed or suspected infection.This retrospective observational cohort study included all critically ill children 21 years or younger admitted to a 20-bed, multidisciplinary, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2016. Data on these children were obtained from an electronic health record database. The pSOFA score was developed by adapting the original SOFA score with age-adjusted cutoffs for the cardiovascular and renal systems and by expanding the respiratory criteria to include noninvasive surrogates of lung injury. Daily pSOFA scores were calculated from admission until day 28 of hospitalization, discharge, or death (whichever came first). Three additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were calculated for comparison.Organ dysfunction measured by the pSOFA score, and sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions.The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The daily pSOFA scores and additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were compared. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve. The pSOFA score was then used to assess the Sepsis-3 definitions in the subgroup of children with confirmed or suspected infection.In all, 6303 patients with 8711 encounters met inclusion criteria. Each encounter was treated independently. Of the 8482 survivors of hospital encounters, 4644 (54.7\%) were male and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69 (17-156) months. Among the 229 nonsurvivors, 127 (55.4\%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 43 (8-144) months. In-hospital mortality was 2.6\%. The maximum pSOFA score had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.94 (95\% CI, 0.92-0.95). The pSOFA score had a similar or better performance than other pediatric organ dysfunction scores. According to the Sepsis-3 definitions, 1231 patients (14.1\%) were classified as having sepsis and had a mortality rate of 12.1\%, and 347 (4.0\%) had septic shock and a mortality rate of 32.3\%. Patients with sepsis were more likely to die than patients with confirmed or suspected infection but no sepsis (odds ratio, 18; 95\% CI, 11-28). Of the 229 patients who died during their hospitalization, 149 (65.0\%) had sepsis or septic shock during their course.The pSOFA score was adapted and validated with age-adjusted variables in critically ill children. Using the pSOFA score, the Sepsis-3 definitions were assessed in children with confirmed or suspected infection. This study is the first assessment, to date, of the Sepsis-3 definitions in critically ill children. Use of these definitions in children is feasible and shows promising results.}

Data Sources:~           We used a previously published database of pediatric critical care randomized controlled trials (PICUtrials.net) derived from searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CENTRAL.           Study Selection:~           We included randomized controlled trials of interventions to children admitted to a PICU with septic or dengue hemorrhagic shock which were published in English.           Data Extraction:~           Study characteristics and outcomes were retrieved by two independent reviewers with disagreement being resolved by a third reviewer. We defined feasibility as 1) recruitment of at least 90\% of the targeted sample size and agreement of the observed outcome rate in the control group with the rate used for the sample size calculation to within 10\% or 2) finding of a statistically significant difference in an interim or final analysis.           Data Synthesis:~           Nineteen of 321 identified articles were selected for review. Fourteen of 19 studies (74\%) provided an a priori definition of their primary outcome measure in their “Methods section.” Mortality rate was the most commonly reported primary outcome (8/14; 57\%), followed by duration of shock (4/14; 29\%) followed by organ failure (1/14; 7\%). Only three of 19 included trials met feasibility criteria.           Conclusions:~           Our review found that use of mortality alone as a primary outcome in pediatric septic shock trials was associated with significant limitations and that long-term patient-centered outcomes were not used in this setting. Composite outcomes incorporating mortality and long-term outcomes should be explored for use in future pediatric septic shock trials.},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE. Our goal was to describe patient and hospital characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and charges for critically ill children with severe sepsis.METHODS. Our study consisted of a retrospective study of children 0 to 19 years of age hospitalized with severe sepsis using the 2003 Kids' Inpatient Database. We generated national estimates of rates of hospitalization and then compared in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and total charges according to patient and hospital characteristics using multivariable regression methods. Severity of illness was measured by using all-patient refined diagnosis-related group severity of illness classification into minor, moderate, major, and extreme severity.RESULTS. There were an estimated 21448 hospitalizations for severe pediatric sepsis nationally in 2003. The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.2\%. Comorbid illness was present in 34\% of hospitalized children. Most (70\%) of the extremely ill children were admitted to children's hospitals. Length of stay was longer among patients with higher illness severity and nonsurvivors compared with survivors (13.5 vs 8.5 days). Hospitalizations at urban or children's hospitals were also associated with longer length of stay than nonchildren's or rural hospitals, respectively. Higher charges were associated with higher illness severity, and nonsurvivors had 2.5-fold higher total charges than survivors. Also, higher charges were observed among hospitalizations in urban or children's hospitals. In multivariable regression analysis, multiple comorbid illnesses, multiple organ dysfunction, and greater severity of illness were associated with higher odds of mortality and longer length of stay. Higher hospital charges and longer length of stay were observed among transfer hospitalizations and among hospitalizations to children's hospitals and nonchildren's teaching hospitals compared with hospitals, which had neither children's nor teaching status.CONCLUSIONS. Mortality from severe pediatric sepsis is associated with patient illness severity, comorbid illness, and multiple organ dysfunction. Many characteristics are associated with resource consumption, including type of hospital, source of admission, and illness severity.}

  abstract     = {Background/aims The Food and Drug Administration recommends research into developing well-defined and reliable endpoints to evaluate treatments for severe influenza requiring hospitalization. A novel 6-category ordinal endpoint of patient health status after 7 days that ranges from death to hospital discharge with resumption of normal activities is being used in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for severe influenza (FLU-IVIG). We compare the power of the ordinal endpoint under a proportional odds model to other types of endpoints as a function of various trial parameters. Methods We used closed-form analysis and empirical simulation to compare the power of the ordinal endpoint to time-to-event, longitudinal, and binary endpoints. In the simulation setting, we varied the treatment effect and the distribution of the placebo group across the follow-up period with consideration of adjustment for baseline health status. Results In the analytic setting, ordinal endpoints of high granularity provided greater power than time-to-event endpoints when most patients in the placebo group had either naturally progressed to the category of hospital discharge by day 7 or were far from hospital discharge on day 7. In the simulation setting, adjustment for baseline health status universally raised power for the proportional odds model. Across different placebo group distributions of the ordinal endpoint regardless of adjustment for baseline health status, only time-to-event endpoints yielded higher power than the ordinal endpoint for certain treatment effects. Conclusions In this case study, the FLU-IVIG ordinal endpoint provided greater power than time-to-event, binary, and longitudinal endpoints for most scenarios of the treatment effect and placebo group distribution, including the target population studied for FLU-IVIG. The ordinal endpoint was only surpassed by the time-to-event endpoint when many patients in the placebo group were on the cusp of hospital discharge on day 7 and the follow-up period for the time-to-event endpoint was extended to allow for additional events. Our general approach for evaluating the power of several potential endpoints for an influenza trial can be used for designing other influenza trials with different target populations and for other trials in other disease areas.},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to create a functional status outcome measure for large outcome studies that is well defined, quantitative, rapid, reliable, minimally dependent on subjective assessments, and applicable to hospitalized pediatric patients across a wide range of ages and inpatient environments. METHODS: Functional Status Scale (FSS) domains of functioning included mental status, sensory functioning, communication, motor functioning, feeding, and respiratory status, categorized from normal (score 1) to very severe dysfunction (score 5). The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System II (ABAS II) established construct validity and calibration within domains. Seven institutions provided PICU patients within 24 hours before or after PICU discharge, high-risk nonPICU patients within 24 hours after admission, and technology-dependent children. Primary care nurses completed the ABAS II. Statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 836 children, with a mean FSS score of 10.3 (SD: 4.4), were studied. Eighteen percent had the minimal possible FSS score of 6, 44\% had FSS scores of 10, 14\% had FSS scores of 15, and 6\% had FSS scores of 20. Each FSS domain was associated with mean ABAS II scores (P .0001). Cells in each domain were collapsed and reweighted, which improved correlations with ABAS II scores (P .001 for improvements). Discrimination was very good for moderate and severe dysfunction (ABAS II categories) and improved with FSS weighting. Intraclass correlations of original and weighted total FSS scores were 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The FSS met our objectives and is well suited for large outcome studies.

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term ({$>$} 6 mo) functional status of PICU patients with significant new functional morbidities at hospital discharge. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort followed-up using structured chart reviews of electronic health records. SETTING: Electronic health records of former PICU patients at seven sites. PATIENTS: Randomly selected patients from the Trichotomous Outcome Prediction in Critical Care study discharged from the hospital with new functional status morbidity who had sufficient electronic health record data to determine functional status. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Long-term functional status was measured with the Functional Status Scale and categorized by comparison to hospital discharge Functional Status Scale. Improvement or new morbidity was based on a change in Functional Status Scale of greater than or equal to 2 in a single domain. Overall, 56\% (n = 71) improved, 15\% (n = 19) did not change, 9\% (n = 11) developed a new morbidity, and 21\% (n = 26) died. The shortest median follow-up time from PICU discharge was 1.4 years for those who died and the longest was 4.0 years for those improved. Functional status at baseline (pre-acute illness) was different among the outcome groups with those that improved having the highest frequency of baseline normal status or only mild dysfunction. Of the longterm survivors with improvement, 82\% (n = 58) improved to normal status or mild dysfunction, 11\% (n = 8) improved to moderate dysfunction, and 7\% (n = 5) improved to severe dysfunction. Trauma patients improved and cancer patients died more frequently than other diagnoses. The long-term outcome groups were not associated with hospital discharge functional status. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of PICU survivors discharged with significant new functional morbidity with follow-up after 6 or more months improved, many to normal status or only mild dysfunction, while 29\% died or developed new morbidity. Of the long-term survivors, 70\% had significant improvement after a median follow-up time of 4.0 years.},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE To derive and validate novel criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock across differently resourced settings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, international, retrospective cohort study in 10 health systems in the US, Colombia, Bangladesh, China, and Kenya, 3 of which were used as external validation sites. Data were collected from emergency and inpatient encounters for children (aged {$<$}18 years) from 2010 to 2019: 3 049 699 in the development (including derivation and internal validation) set and 581 317 in the external validation set. EXPOSURE Stacked regression models to predict mortality in children with suspected infection were derived and validated using the best-performing organ dysfunction subscores from 8 existing scores. The final model was then translated into an integer-based score used to establish binary criteria for sepsis and septic shock. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome for all analyses was in-hospital mortality. Model- and integer-based score performance measures included the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC; primary) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC; secondary). For binary criteria, primary performance measures were positive predictive value and sensitivity. RESULTS Among the 172 984 children with suspected infection in the first 24 hours (development set; 1.2\% mortality), a 4-organ-system model performed best. The integer version of that model, the Phoenix Sepsis Score, had AUPRCs of 0.23 to 0.38 (95\% CI range, 0.20-0.39) and AUROCs of 0.71 to 0.92 (95\% CI range, 0.70-0.92) to predict mortality in the validation sets. Using a Phoenix Sepsis Score of 2 points or higher in children with suspected infection as criteria for sepsis and sepsis plus 1 or more cardiovascular point as criteria for septic shock resulted in a higher positive predictive value and higher or similar sensitivity compared with the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC) criteria across differently resourced settings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The novel Phoenix sepsis criteria, which were derived and validated using data from higher- and lower-resource settings, had improved performance for the diagnosis of pediatric sepsis and septic shock compared with the existing IPSCC criteria.},

  abstract     = {Importance               Sepsis is a leading cause of death among children worldwide. Current pediatric-specific criteria for sepsis were published in 2005 based on expert opinion. In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, but it excluded children.                                         Objective               To update and evaluate criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children.                                         Evidence Review               The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) convened a task force of 35 pediatric experts in critical care, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, general pediatrics, nursing, public health, and neonatology from 6 continents. Using evidence from an international survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and a new organ dysfunction score developed based on more than 3 million electronic health record encounters from 10 sites on 4 continents, a modified Delphi consensus process was employed to develop criteria.                                         Findings                                Based on survey data, most pediatric clinicians used                 sepsis                 to refer to infection with life-threatening organ dysfunction, which differed from prior pediatric sepsis criteria that used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which have poor predictive properties, and included the redundant term,                 severe sepsis                 . The SCCM task force recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Children with a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points had in-hospital mortality of 7.1\% in higher-resource settings and 28.5\% in lower-resource settings, more than 8 times that of children with suspected infection not meeting these criteria. Mortality was higher in children who had organ dysfunction in at least 1 of 4—respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological—organ systems that was not the primary site of infection.                 Septic shock                 was defined as children with sepsis who had cardiovascular dysfunction, indicated by at least 1 cardiovascular point in the Phoenix Sepsis Score, which included severe hypotension for age, blood lactate exceeding 5 mmol/L, or need for vasoactive medication. Children with septic shock had an in-hospital mortality rate of 10.8\% and 33.5\% in higher- and lower-resource settings, respectively.                                                        Conclusions and Relevance               The Phoenix sepsis criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children were derived and validated by the international SCCM Pediatric Sepsis Definition Task Force using a large international database and survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and modified Delphi consensus approach. A Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 identified potentially life-threatening organ dysfunction in children younger than 18 years with infection, and its use has the potential to improve clinical care, epidemiological assessment, and research in pediatric sepsis and septic shock around the world.},

  abstract  = {Wassily Hoeffding was born on June 12, 1914 in Mustamaki, Finland, near St. Petersburg (now Leningrad), USSR. His parents were of Danish origin; his father was an economist and his mother had studied medicine. Although at that time, Finland was a part of the Russian Empire, the Bolshevik movement was quite intense and consolidated under the Lenin dictatorship in the Civil War of 1918-20. The Hoeffding family left Russia for Denmark in 1920, and four years later, they moved on to Berlin. In 1933, Wassily finished high school and went on to college to study economics. However, a year later, he gave up economics and entered Berlin University to study mathematics. He earned a Ph.D. degree from Berlin University in 1940 with a dissertation in correlation theory, which dealt with some properties of bivariate distributions that are invariant under arbitrary monotone transformations of the margins. In this context, he studied some (mostly, descriptive) aspects of rank correlations, and a few years later, while investigating the sampling aspects of such measures, he formulated in a remarkably general and highly original form the general distribution theory of symmetric, unbiased estimators (which he termed U-statistics). This is depicted in this outstanding article (under commentary). During World War II, Wassily worked in Berlin partly as an editorial assistant and partly as a research assistant in actuarial science. In September 1946, he was able to immigrate to the United States, and there he started attending lectures at Columbia University in New York. In 1947, he was invited by Harold Hotelling to join the newly established department of Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Since then Wassily had been in Chapel Hill with occasional visits to other campuses (Columbia University and Cornell University in New York, the Steklov Institute in Leningrad, USSR, and the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta, among others). In 1979, he retired from active service. He died on February 28, 1991 at Chapel Hill.},

  abstract     = {Generalized pairwise comparisons and win statistics (i.e., win ratio, win odds and net benefit) are advantageous in analyzing and interpreting a composite of multiple outcomes in clinical trials. An important limitation of these statistics is their inability to adjust for covariates other than by stratified analysis. Because the win ratio does not account for ties, the win odds, a modification that includes ties, has attracted attention. We review and combine information on the win odds to articulate the statistical inferences for the win odds. We also show alternative variance estimators based on the exact permutation and bootstrap as well as statistical inference via the probabilistic index. Finally, we extend multiple-covariate regression probabilistic index models to the win odds with a univariate outcome. As an illustration we apply the regression models to the data in the CHARM trial.},

Conclusions:~           Pediatric oncology patients account for a relatively high proportion of severe sepsis in children. Available data suggest that outcomes among the non-HSCT oncology population are not substantially different from that of the general population. Data suggest that children with cancer (non-HSCT) who survive their septic episode will have a high probability of 6-month survival. In light of these findings, pediatric oncology patients are an important source of potential candidates for clinical trials of sepsis. In addition, HSCT patients seem to have significantly worse outcomes from sepsis than the non-HSCT oncology population, and thus, their participation in clinical trials is needed. However, in view of these worse outcomes, it is important to stratify the randomization for this population and to ensure that studies are adequately powered to assess outcomes in this subgroup.},

Mortality may not be an adequate measure of outcome if it is reduced at the cost of increased disability. No neonatal organ dysfunction score has yet been validated as a reliable surrogate for disability-free survival. To validate a score as a surrogate would require randomized trials showing 1) a causal connection between change in the score and change in disability-free survival and 2) that the score fully captured all the effects of treatment on disability-free survival. Neonatal illness severity scores provide a convenient, but imperfect, tool to adjust for risk of sepsis in observational studies. They can help to stratify infants by risk of sepsis at entry to trials, allowing analyses of outcome in predefined subgroups. However, they cannot circumvent the need for randomized trials of adequate size in neonatal sepsis, which address disability-free survival as the primary outcome.},

These issues could be addressed through the development and use of an agreed standardized collection of outcomes, known as a core outcome set, which should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all trials for a specific clinical area. Accumulating work in this area has identified the need for general guidance on the development of core outcome sets. Key issues to consider in the development of a core outcome set include its scope, the stakeholder groups to involve, choice of consensus method and the achievement of a consensus.},

  abstract     = {Objective To identify parents’ prioritised outcomes by combining qualitative findings from two trial feasibility studies of interventions for paediatric suspected severe infection. Design Qualitative synthesis combining parent interview data from the Fluids in Shock (FiSh) and Fever feasibility studies. Parents had experience of their child being admitted to a UK emergency department or intensive care unit with a suspected infection. Participants n=: 85 parents. FiSh study: n=41 parents, 37 mothers, 4 fathers, 7 were bereaved. Fever study: n=44 parents, 33 mothers, 11 fathers, 7 were bereaved. Results In addition to survival, parents prioritised short-term outcomes including: organ and physiological functioning (eg, heart rate, breathing rate and temperature); their child looking and/or behaving more like their normal self; and length of time on treatments or mechanical support. Longer term prioritised outcomes included effects of illness on child health and development. We found that parents’ prioritisation of outcomes was influenced by their experience of their child’s illness, survival and the point at which they are asked about outcomes of importance in the course of their child’s illness. Conclusions Findings provide insight into parent prioritised outcomes to inform the design of future trials investigating treatments for paediatric suspected or proven severe infection as well as core outcome set development work.},

  abstract     = {Mann–Whitney-type causal effects are generally applicable to outcome variables with a natural ordering, have been recommended for clinical trials because of their clinical relevance and interpretability and are particularly useful in analysing an ordinal composite outcome that combines an original primary outcome with death and possibly treatment discontinuation. In this article, we consider robust and efficient estimation of such causal effects in observational studies and clinical trials. For observational studies, we propose and compare several estimators: regression estimators based on an outcome regression (OR) model or a generalised probabilistic index (GPI) model, an inverse probability weighted estimator based on a propensity score model and two doubly robust (DR), locally efficient estimators. One of the DR estimators involves a propensity score model and an OR model, is consistent and asymptotically normal under the union of the two models and attains the semiparametric information bound when both models are correct. The other DR estimator has the same properties with the OR model replaced by a GPI model. For clinical trials, we extend an existing augmented estimator based on a GPI model and propose a new one based on an OR model. The methods are evaluated and compared in simulation experiments and applied to a clinical trial in cardiology and an observational study in obstetrics.}
